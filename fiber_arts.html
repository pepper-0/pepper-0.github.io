        <h3> â‹†.Ëšâœ®ðŸŽ§âœ®Ëš.â‹† a collection of the many hobbies and interests i've taken up, as it relates to fiber arts</h3>

          <p class = "centerText"> Summer-Fall 2024 | now... technically this took a year because i wanted to make it look perfect. so if you counted all 3 attempts, i probably would've spent about 50 hours on it or so</p>

        <p>another note: i don't often create formal fiber arts projects, just because a majority of them are just me altering things or little gifts for friends. here's some of my work from that!: </p>
