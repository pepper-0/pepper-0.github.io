        <h3>interesting tidbits about me</h3>
        <p>oh and yes this is the same as the info on my homepage, but not in java form :)</p>
        <ul >
          <li>i do taekwondo recreationally, and i'm a purple belt.</li>
          <li>one of my hobbies is fiber arts (which includes crocheting, knitting, and sewing. i like to call it the "trifecta" of fiber arts lol. you can check out some of my stuff on my fiber arts portfolio page!</li>
          <li>the goal is to go into computational biology. obviously this isn't the most widespread major, if a school i'm applying to doesn't have it, i'll double major biology and computer science.</li>
          <li>i wouldn't say i'm the most avid linguist, but i speak english, cantonese (at home), mandarin (from school).</li>
          <li>and then for coding, i'm most familiar with java (thank you ap csa), python (bwsi and girls who code), html, css (obviously, since i am making a website with the languages after all)</li>
          <li>and of course, i had to struggle with unity for a good while in bwsi and so i can say i'm 10% good at c#. mostly (entirely) because of java though.</li>
