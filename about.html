      <!-- basic information about me -->
        <h3>well to start off, here's some basic information about me:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  i am a rising high school senior (class of 2026) </li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  i'm in MA (yes, the state of the boston tea party ü¶Öü¶Ö)</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  i'm born and raised in the US, but my parents are from HK, so i speak cantonese at home</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  siblings: üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. pets: üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. but i would like to have a cat and/or dog when i'm older. </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>recent activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>  ‚òë  almost complete with Girls Who Code's Pathways (2025) program! i've finished the Cybersecurity and Data Science + AI tracks' courses, and this personal website is in fact the first course in the Web Development track.</li>
          <li>  ‚òë  just completed MIT's Beaver Works Summer Institute (2025)! Took the Serious Games Development with AI course, and learned a lot of things about coding :) (lost a lot of sleep in the process though...)</li>
          <li>  ‚òí  barely surviving my AP summer work (best example of that is AP Chinese... because my chinese teacher wants us to do 6 separate assignments ü´† </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>more interesting tidbits about me</h3>
        <p>and yes this is the same as the info on my homepage, but not in java form :)</p>
        <ul >
          <li>  ‚ú¶  i do taekwondo recreationally, and i'm a purple belt.</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  one of my hobbies is fiber arts (which includes crocheting, knitting, and sewing. i like to call it the "trifecta" of fiber arts lol). you can check out some of my stuff on my fiber arts portfolio page!</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  the goal is to go into computational biology. obviously this isn't the most widespread major, if a school i'm applying to doesn't have it, i'll double major biology and computer science.</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  i wouldn't say i love learning lagnuages, but i speak english, cantonese (at home), mandarin (from school). i also used to try to learn japanese...but school got a little too hard for that.</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  and then for coding, i'm most familiar with java (thank you ap csa), python (bwsi and girls who code), html, css (obviously, since i am making a website with the languages after all)</li>
          <li>  ‚ú¶  and of course, i had to struggle with unity for a good while in bwsi and so i can say i'm 10% good at c#. mostly (entirely) because of java though.</li>
        </ul>
